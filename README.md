# Movie Gross Correlation
This case study focuses on data cleaning and correlation analysis using Python. The dataset used for this project contains information on over 6,820 movies released between 1980 and 2020, and was scraped from IMDB using Python. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies?resource=download).

To clean and analyze the data, we have performed the following tasks:

1- Imported various libraries to support our analysis.

2- Loaded the data from a CSV file into our Python environment.

3- Removed rows with NULL values to ensure that all data is complete and accurate.

4- Modified the data types of certain columns for a cleaner and more organized look.

5- Removed duplicate rows to ensure that the data is unique.

6- Used Pearson correlation to check for relationships between different features in the dataset.

7- Created scatter and regression plots using Pyplot and Seaborn to visualize the data.

8- Generated heatmaps to further visualize the correlations between features.

Through this process, we have gained valuable experience in applying data cleaning and correlation analysis techniques to real-world data. The final product is a clean and well-structured dataset with insights into the relationships between different features.
